## ABSTRACT

---

Implementation Projects provide support to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This project at Jarvis Christian University (JCU) seeks to train a diverse group of students by making innovative connections between education, interdisciplinary STEM research, and social learning strategies. The goal of this project is to increase the number of underrepresented minority students pursuing STEM degrees to be competitive for graduate and professional schools. The project will impact the academic success, retention, and graduation rate of students enrolled in STEM degrees and make sustainable change to STEM programs at the institution.

The project seeks to address several causal factors of STEM student achievement gaps through implementation and extension of evidence-based teaching in the STEM areas. The infusion of Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) into lower-level STEM courses will expose students early to hands-on research approaches with the potential to advance their understanding of their chosen field and promote critical thinking skills. The project will gain insight into the effects of interventions on social learning strategies, including growth mindset, sense of belonging, and self-efficacy. In addition, the development of the new Engineering program will provide a strong general foundation in the field of engineering and equip students to excel in higher-level courses and engineering specializations. Moreover, student participation in faculty mentored research during the academic year and summer will contribute to the advancement of faculty research and increase JCU STEM students? ability to compete successfully for graduate research fellowships. Finally, this opportunity will promote new and expanded collaborations for degree and research opportunities with other institutions through the establishment of the Interdisciplinary Research and Education Center (IREC). The project, which may serve as a model for broad STEM intervention, will be assessed to determine the impact of faculty mentoring, internships, research experiences, and social learning strategies on the outcomes of retention and graduation rates of STEM majors.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

## Jarvis students to learn higher levels of cancer research through NSF grant

![image](imgs/KLTVNews.png)

TYLER, Texas (KLTV) - Jarvis Christian University is one of five historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, that received a grant from the National Science Foundation for their groundbreaking undergraduate cancer cell research.

Undergraduate students are the ones conducting the research to potentially find plant-based treatments for different forms of cancer.

The lab currently has five young women who are working with plants and spices to extract nanoparticles and biomedical compounds that could have cancer-fighting properties.

Their names are Itzel Soto, Patricia Soto, Daniella Johnson, Esther Chicou and Chinaza Jennifer Okwuoma.

## JARVIS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY IN HAWKINS, TEXAS, AWARDED $2.25 MILLION NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRANT


Jarvis Christian University biology professor Dr. Shakhawat Bhuiyan is the principal investigator on a new $2.25 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant titled “Interdisciplinary Research Infusion into STEM Education Undergraduate Program.” The new NSF grant continues over the next five years, with a start date of August 1, 2023, and running through July 31, 2028.  Each year, Jarvis will submit an annual project report in accordance with the award terms and conditions.

“This continuing grant gives students the opportunity to research plant-based bioactive compounds and nanoparticles to potentially develop new treatments for cancer,” Bhuiyan said.

This new NSF funding opportunity is made in accordance with NSF 20-559 Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program. Co-principal investigators include Jarvis Christian University professors Dr. Glendora Carter, Dr. Widodo Samyono, and Dr. Yefer Suarez, along with Southern University and A&M College System professor Dr. Kenie R. Moses. Jarvis Assistant Professor of Social Work Gwendolyn Lee will be the project manager of this grant to conduct social sciences research with the students.

“We are very proud of the ongoing work in research that Dr. Bhuiyan does with his colleagues and students," said Jarvis Christian University President Glenell M. Lee-Pruitt, Ph.D.  "We commend him and support his efforts to bring research scholarship to East Texas by way of Jarvis Christian University.”

The project seeks to train a diverse group of students by making innovative connections between education and research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and to increase the number of underrepresented minority students pursuing STEM degrees. The project is expected to impact the academic success, retention, and graduate rate of students enrolled in STEM degrees and make sustainable changes to the STEM programs at JCU.

Working on the NSF grant will enable Jarvis students to be competitive for consideration for graduate and professional schools by having done interdisciplinary STEM research and social learning strategies as undergraduates.  Students will gain insight into the effects of interventions on social learning strategies, including growth mindset, sense of belonging, and self-efficacy.

 “The infusion of Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences into lower-level STEM courses exposes students early to hands-on research with the potential to advance student understanding of their chosen field and to promote critical thinking skills,” Dr. Bhuiyan said. “Student participation in faculty-mentored research during the academic year and summer internships contributes to students’ ability to compete successfully for graduate research fellowships.” 

The project the students will work on involves hands-on research in the biomedical sciences, mathematical modeling, and an introduction to engineering program, Bhuiyan said. 

“The students will study plant-based bioactive compounds and green synthesis of nanoparticles in the potential treatment and drug development to find natural answers to combat growing cancer cells,” Bhuiyan said.  Students will be using orchids, aloe vera plants, mint, a variety of grapes, berries, and other fruits, cacti, and an assortment of vegetables and spices. 

Students will have the opportunity as undergraduates to conduct biomedical research, learn computational and mathematical modeling, write, and present their peer-reviewed research at conferences. 

Moreover, student participation in faculty-mentored research during the academic year and summer will contribute to the advancement of faculty research and increase JCU STEM students’ ability to compete successfully for graduate research fellowships.

Finally, this opportunity will promote new and expanded collaborations for degree and research opportunities with other institutions through the establishment of the Interdisciplinary Research and Education Center.

 In addition, the development of the new engineering program will provide a strong general foundation in the field of engineering and equip students to excel in higher-level courses and engineering specializations.

Jarvis Christian University is dedicated to empowering students to achieve their career goals through an affordable academic experience that prepares them for today’s global economy. Whether a student is a recent high school graduate or a working adult seeking career advancement, Jarvis Christian University develops students of all ages intellectually, socially, spiritually, and emotionally.
