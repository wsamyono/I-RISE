## Resource Needs/List
1) Google Colab. The students use it for programming in Python to introduce the students with Python coding without installing Python in their computers. https://colab.research.google.com/                                                                                                                    
2) Jupyter Notebooks. The students may use TACC and Jetstream 2 Resources for using the Jupyter Notebooks. Texas Advanced Computing Center Jetstream2               
3) Anaconda Navigator. The students may experience installing Python in their own computers. The link is this: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/navigator/index.html      
4) Python. The students need to learn this popular language to solve problems in biology. This is the link: https://www.python.org/                                 
5) SciPy. The students need to learn algorithms in solving biological problems. This is the link: https://scipy.org/                                                
6) scikit-learn (sklearn). Simple and efficient tools for machine learning. They students may use it in the future. The link is this: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/                                                                                                                                             
7) GitHub. The students need to collaborate in solving biological problems, so they can use it to share codes. The link to our GitHub repository is this: https://github.com/wsamyono/BulldogTeamFacHackGW23
