        "#Control Flow: Repetition via While Loops\n",
        "Whereas the if statement tests a condition exactly once and branches the code execution accordingly, the while statement instructs an enclosed block of code to repeat so long as the given condition (the continuation condition) is satisfied. In fact, while can be considered as a repeated if. This is the simplest form of a loop, and is termed a while loop (Fig 3). The condition check occurs once before entering the associated block; thus, Python’s while is a pre-test loop. (Some languages feature looping constructs wherein the condition check is performed after a first iteration; C’s do–while is an example of such a post-test loop. This is mentioned because looping constructs should be carefully examined when comparing source code in different languages.) If the condition is true, the block is executed and then the interpreter effectively jumps to the while statement that began the block. If the condition is false, the block is skipped and the interpreter jumps to the first statement after the block. The code below is a simple example of a while loop, used to generate a counter that prints each integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive):"

        "Recursion is a subtle concept. A while loop is conceptually straightforward: a block of statements comprising the body of the loop is repeatedly executed as long as a condition is true. A recursive function, on the other hand, calls itself repeatedly, effectively creating a loop. Recursion is the most natural programming approach (or paradigm) for solving a complex problem that can be decomposed into (easier) subproblems, each of which resembles the overall problem. Mathematically, problems that are formulated in this manner are known as recurrence relations, and a classic example is the factorial (below). Recursion is so fundamental and general a concept that iterative constructs (for, while loops) can be expressed recursively; in fact, some languages dispense with loops entirely and rely on recursion for all repetition. The key idea is that a recursive function calls itself from within its own function body, thus progressing one step closer to the final solution at each self-call. The recursion terminates once it has reached a trivially simple final operation, termed the base case. (Here, the word “simple” means only that evaluation of the final operation yields no further recursive steps, with no implication as to the computational complexity of that final operation.) Calculation of the factorial function, f(n) = n!, is a classic example of a problem that is elegantly coded in a recursive manner. Recall that the factorial of a natural number, n, is defined as:\n",

Note that this recursive implementation of the factorial perfectly matches its mathematical definition. This often holds true, and many mathematical operations on data are most easily expressed recursively. When the Python interpreter encounters the call to the factorial function within the function block itself (line 6), it generates a new instance of the function on the fly, while retaining the original function in memory (technically, these function instances occupy the runtime’s call stack). Python places the current function call on hold in the call stack while the newly-called function is evaluated. This process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns a value. Next, the previous function instance in the call stack resumes execution, calculates its result, and returns it. This process of traversing the call stack continues until the very first invocation has returned. At that point, the call stack is empty and the function evaluation has completed.\n",

Any difficult problem (e.g., f(n) = n!) that can be expressed as a simpler instance of the same problem (e.g., f(n) = n*f(n − 1)) is amenable to a recursive solution. Only when the problem is trivially easy (1!, factorial(1) above) does the recursive solution give a direct (one-step) answer. Recursive approaches fundamentally differ from more iterative (also known as procedural) strategies: Iterative constructs (loops) express the entire solution to a problem in more explicit form, whereas recursion repeatedly makes a problem simpler until it is trivial. Many data-processing functions are most naturally and compactly solved via recursion.\n",

However, if the argument is negative or is an even number, the base case will never be reached (note that line 5 subtracts 2), causing the function call to simply hang, as would an infinite loop. (In this scenario, Python’s maximum recursion depth will be reached and the call stack will overflow.) Thus, in addition to defining the function’s base case, it is also crucial to confirm that all possible inputs will reach the base case. A valid recursive function must progress towards—and eventually reach—the base case with every call.
